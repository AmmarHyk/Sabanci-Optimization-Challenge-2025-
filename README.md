# üèÜ Sabancƒ± University Optimization Challenge 2025 - Finalist Solution

This repository contains the code and methodology our team developed for the **Sabancƒ± University Optimization Challenge 2025**, where we were honored to qualify as one of the **top 7 finalist teams** out of 71 entries from across T√ºrkiye. The competition was hosted by Sabancƒ± University and [ICRON Technologies](https://www.icron.com/).

Our solution addresses a two-stage optimization problem focused on the efficient and equitable deployment of healthcare units to underserved communities.

## Problem Description

The challenge was a two-stage problem: first, the optimal deployment of healthcare units, and second, the optimal routing of ambulances to supply them.

### Stage 1: Healthcare Unit Deployment

The first stage objective was to determine the optimal placement of $M$ healthcare units among $N$ communities. The goal was to minimize the **maximum population-weighted distance** traveled by any community member to access their assigned unit.

* **Objective:** Minimize the maximum value of $Population_n \times \text{Distance}(n, j)$ for any community $n$ assigned to facility $j$.
* **Constraints:**
    * Exactly $M$ units must be deployed[cite: 6].
    * Units can only be placed at community locations.
    * Each community $n$ must be assigned to exactly one unit.
    * Each unit $j$ has a maximum capacity $C$, and the total population of communities assigned to it cannot exceed this capacity.

### Stage 2: Equipment Distribution (Vehicle Routing)

Given the optimal locations from Stage 1, the second stage involved planning the logistics to supply these units from a central depot.

* **Objective:** Minimize the **total travel distance** for a fleet of ambulances to deliver equipment to all deployed units.
* **Constraints:**
    * Each ambulance has a capacity of $Q=10000$.
    * The equipment demand for each unit is equal to the total population it serves[cite: 14].
    * All routes must start and end at the depot.
    * Every deployed unit must be visited exactly once.

**Evaluation:** Solutions were ranked primarily by the Stage 1 objective, followed by the Stage 2 objective, and finally by the number of routes used.

##  Our Solution Approach

We developed a hybrid approach: a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP) for the Stage 1 deployment and a custom greedy heuristic for the Stage 2 routing.

## Stage 1: Mathematical Formulation

This stage focuses on optimally deploying $M$ healthcare units across $N$ communities to minimize the **maximum population-weighted distance** any community must travel to its assigned unit.

### Sets and Parameters
- $N$: Set of communities  
- $Neighbors(n)$: Set of candidate unit locations allowed for community $n$  
- $P_n$: Population of community $n$  
- $d_{nj}$: Distance between community $n$ and community $j$  
- $C$: Capacity of each healthcare unit  
- $M$: Number of units to be deployed  

### Decision Variables
- $D_j \in \{0,1\}$: 1 if a unit is deployed at community $j$, otherwise 0  
- $T_{nj} \in \{0,1\}$: 1 if community $n$ is assigned to a unit at community $j$, otherwise 0  
- $Z \ge 0$: Maximum population-weighted distance among all assignments

### Objective Function
Minimize the worst-case (maximum) weighted access distance:

$$
\min Z
$$

---

### Constraints

1. **Each community assigned exactly once**
   
$$
\sum_{j \in Neighbors(n)} T_{nj} = 1 \quad \forall n \in N
$$

3. **Assignments only to deployed units**
   
$$
T_{nj} \le D_j \quad \forall n \in N, \; j \in Neighbors(n)
$$

4. **Exactly $M$ units must be deployed**
   
$$
\sum_{j \in N} D_j = M
$$

5. **Capacity restriction at each deployed unit**
   
$$
\sum_{n \mid j \in Neighbors(n)} P_n \cdot T_{nj} \le C \cdot D_j \quad \forall j \in N
$$

6. **Definition of maximum weighted distance**
   
$$
P_n \cdot d_{nj} \cdot T_{nj} \le Z \quad \forall n \in N, \; j \in Neighbors(n)
$$
       

### Stage 2: Greedy Heuristic for Routing

For the Stage 2 vehicle routing problem, we implemented a fast and effective greedy heuristic. This approach is similar to a "First Fit Decreasing" strategy used in bin packing.

1.  **Calculate Demand:** First, we calculate the total equipment demand for each of the $M$ deployed centers (equal to the total population served).
2.  **Sort by Demand:** We sort the deployed centers in **descending order** of their demand.
3.  **Build Routes:** We iterate through the sorted list, adding centers to the `current_route` one by one, as long as the total `current_load` plus the new center's `demand` does not exceed the ambulance capacity $Q=10000$.
4.  **Create New Route:** When a center cannot be added to the current route, the route is "closed" (saved), and a new route is started with that center.
5.  **Calculate Distance:** Finally, we loop through all generated routes, calculating the total Euclidean distance for each trip (Depot $\rightarrow$ Center 1 $\rightarrow$ ... $\rightarrow$ Center k $\rightarrow$ Depot) and sum them up.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run the Code

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/Your-Repository-Name.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/Your-Repository-Name.git)
    cd Your-Repository-Name
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    The code relies on `gurobipy`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.
    ```bash
    pip install gurobipy numpy matplotlib
    ```
    *Note: `gurobipy` requires a Gurobi license. A free academic license is available.*

3.  **Update File Path:**
    Open `Code File.py` and **change the file path on line 4** to point to the instance file (e.g., `Instance_1.txt`) on your local machine.
    ```python
    # Original:
    with open("C:/Users/ammar/OneDrive/Desktop/FINAL_ROUND_INSTANCES_OPTCHAL2025/Instance_1.txt", 'r') as file:
    
    # Change to:
    with open("path/to/your/Instance_1.txt", 'r') as file:
    ```

4.  **Run the Script:**
    ```bash
    python "Code File.py"
    ```
    The script will print the Stage 1 and Stage 2 assignments and objectives to the console and generate a `healthcare_deployment_plot.png` file visualizing the solution.
